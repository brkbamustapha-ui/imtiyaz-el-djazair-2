/**
 * Storage for files uploaded at runtime.
 *
 * These used to be written under ./storage. That works on a machine you own and
 * nowhere else: a serverless host mounts a read-only filesystem and gives every
 * invocation its own copy, so a file written while handling one request is gone
 * by the next one — the upload appears to succeed and the image 404s forever.
 *
 * So the bytes live in the database, addressed by `key`: exactly the path that
 * appears in the URL (`general/mfk3d-a1b2.webp` -> `/media/general/mfk3d-a1b2.webp`).
 * One code path locally and in production, and no second service to configure.
 *
 * Files that are part of the design — the logo, the partner marks, the campus
 * photographs — are NOT here. They are committed under public/assets and served
 * as static files, which is both faster and free.
